  # IÂ´m Priscila Gallinari Petroni!

  I'm a **#tech enthusiast** who loves learning new things and exploring the world of tech.
  
  You'll find I'm a programming student who's discovered a whole new world. I'm proactive and always looking to learn and grow. This year, I started coding (who would've thought?!) and I'm excited to apply what I've learned to cool projects. I believe teamwork makes the dream work and I'm open to new opportunities.

  Want to chat and share knowledge and experiences?"
